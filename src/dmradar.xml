   <SYNOPSIS>
	Perform polar quad-tree adaptive binning on 2D images
   </SYNOPSIS>
   <DESC>
      <PARA>
    `dmradar' performs the a polar equivalent of a quad-tree 
    adaptive binning algorithm used in `dmradar'.  Rather than 
    splitting the image in X and Y, 
    it works in polar coordinates:  angle and radii. 
        </PARA>
 

      <PARA>
	The tool computes the
	signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the entire image and
    for the four sub-images taken by dividing the 
    angle in half and the radius in half.  Based on the 'method' parameter
    the algorithm will then either accept the full image, or
    iterate over each of the sub-images, repeating the divide-by-two 
    algorithm until the threshold criteria is met or a single pixel
    remains.
        </PARA>


    <PARA>
    With method=1, if the SNR of any one of the sub-image greater than the 
    input threshold, then the sub-images are used.
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
    With method=2, if the SNR of two sub-image that share a common side (ie not 
    diagonal) are greater than the input threshold then the sub-images are used.    
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
    With method=3, if the SNR of any three of the sub-images is greater than
    the input threshold, then the sub-images are used.
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
    With method=4, the SNR of all of the sub-images must be above the threshold
    for the sub-images to be used.  This is the most strict 
    lower limit test; it may lead to some unexpected behavior
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
    With method=0, if the SNR of the entire image is greater than the
	input threshold, the sub-images are used. This make the threshold
    behave as an upper limit (image keeps dividing until SNR of the
    sub-image falls  below the threshold).       A description of
	the technique can be found in Samet, H. "The Quadtree and
	Related Hierarchical Data Structures", 1984, ACM Computing 
	Surveys, 16, 187.  
    </PARA>
    
    <PARA>
     For each sub-image, the process is repeated until the SNR 
     criteria is met.    
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
    	The output pixels are then the sum of the pixels in
	the sub-image divided by the area of the sub-image.  The tool
	can also optionally output the area, SNR, and a mask/group
	number for each output pixel. 
	</PARA>



      <PARA>
	Pixels that fall outside of the data subspace, NaNs, and
	integer NULL value pixels are all ignored when computing the
	sum, area and SNR. 
      </PARA>


	<PARA>
	 If no error file is supplied (inerrfile parameter), then a
	 Gaussian approximation "(sqrt(image value))" is used. If an
	 error file is supplied, it must be the same size as the input
	 image.   
      </PARA>

	<PARA>
	The output mask file can be used with 
	<HREF link="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmmaskbin.html">dmmaskbin</HREF> to group
	another image of the same dimensions using the same bin
	sizes.  This is useful say to group the data based on
	broad-band energy filter and then group narrow band images
	using the same grouping scheme.
	</PARA>

    <PARA title="Image Edges">
      There is some special treatment for the edge of images, or
      more specifically, pixels outside the subspace.  If all 
      the pixels in the sub-image are outside the subspace, then
      that sub-image will be treated as having a SNR above threshold.
      This allows for some better edge handing when working
      with images that contain large borders or gaps of unexposed 
      pixels.

          <PARA>
            The method parameter describes the number of sub-images
            that must be above the SNR threshold for the sub-images
            to be further divided.   A value of 1 means that only 1 of the 
            sub-images must be above threshold for them all to be
            divided.  A value of 2 means that two sub-images that
            specifically share a common side (ie not diagonal) 
            are above threshold then all 4 sub-images are divided. 
            3 requires any three sub-image be above threshold, and 4
            requires all 4 sub-image be above threshold for them
            to be further subdivided.  
                            
          </PARA>        
          <PARA>
            The value of 0 is different in that the sub-images are 
            always divided if the parent image is above the SNR threshold.
            So while the other methods act as lower limits, a
            value of 0 acts as an upper limit.
